                      <p class="history-data policy-rules">The Electronics and Communication Engineering Deptt. at NSIT is one of the reputed departments amongst technical colleges all over India. It offers courses in wide areas which produce the best brains in technical fields every year. Under the guidance of our Dean Prof. Raj Senani, who currently holds the reputation of publishing more than 100 papers in international journals, students of this department are exposed to the best and the latest knowledge available in the field.In a course of three years, college has provided students with in-depth knowledge of courses which are pre-requisites for any future electronics engineer. Practical knowledge is also imbibed by the well-equipped laboratories having the best available technology.</p>
                      <p class="history-data" style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: 500; color: rgb(34,40,43)"><b>Computer Engineering (COE) :</b></p>
                      <p class="history-data policy-rules">The Division of Computer engineering was started during the 1984-85 session. Students from this branch have a knack for coding but also an in-depth knowledge of the hardware aspect of programming as well. In the COE department, the thrust is to cover all the basic and specialized courses as per industry needs.</p>
                      <p class="history-data" style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: 500; color: rgb(34,40,43)"><b>Instrumentation and Control Engineering (ICE) :</b></p>
                      <p class="history-data policy-rules">Started in 1989, this offers many courses of Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering apart from a variety of courses from Instrumentation Technology, Modern Control Theory, Robotics, Industrial Electronics, Computer Controlled Instrumentation, Artificial Intelligence, Sensors and Transducers, PC Interfacing, Telemetry etc. A holistic approach has been adopted while framing curriculum, updating infrastructural facilities and improving teaching methods. The courses, which have not found a berth in the core curriculum, have been incorporated as elective courses. Students do intensive use of Microprocessors and Computers to understand the hardware and software aspect of Intelligent Instrumentation. Courses on industrial business economics and management are an integral part of the curriculum. The Mechatronics laboratory developed in NSIT for imparting training in the field of electronic and mechanical systems was the first one of its kind in India.</p>
                      <p class="history-data" style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: 500; color: rgb(34,40,43)"><b>Information Technology (IT) :</b></p>
                      <p class="history-data policy-rules">In this high-tech era, the study of information technology is indispensable for the modern industries and economy. The B.E. Information Technology curriculum not only emphasizes on computer science but also encompasses subjects related to management, electronics, business, communication etc. Further, Industrial Training forms an integral component of the curriculum so as the students are able to meet the challenges faced by today's industries. It is undoubtedly the best upcoming branch with better future prospects than any who exist in the competitive environment today. Although recently established, it has shown a spectacular placement record by students laying their hands on some of the best MNCs and proving to be the greatest assets these companies have ever possessed.</p>
                      <p class="history-data" style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: 500; color: rgb(34,40,43)"><b>Manufacturing Process and Automation Engineering (MPAE) :</b></p>
                      <p class="history-data policy-rules">In today's world, manufacturing is an important barometer in gauging the development in a country. It is also important to notice the transformation taking place vis-a-vis the automation of manufacturing systems. Keeping this in mind the course has been tailor-made for the industry with each student having the required amount of expertise not only in engineering subjects but also in critical management related issues such as production management, quality control, & financial management. Started in the batch of 1995-96 the department aims at providing its students with tools and knowledge necessary to succeed in this competitive world.The All Terrain Vehicle made for Mini-Baja South Africa in 2009, the performance of the FSAE Team in FSAE India 2009, the NSIT Solar Car Project and NSIT Moonbuggy Team have all won accolades at various international competitions and this shows their skills at practical implementation.</p>

                      <p class="history-data policy-rules">Biotechnology has seen a significant growth in the last few years. With increasing pace of development in genomics and recombinant DNA technology, a biotechnology engineer has been perceived as a catalyst for bringing about a change in the modern society. But there has been a dearth of highly qualified 'technical' manpower in the field. Keeping this in mind, the institute started the department of Biotechnology from academic session 2004-05 with an intake of 20 students. The aim was to produce highly motivated globally competitive professionals. The department has a team of dedicated and experienced faculty committed to impart quality education. Eminent teachers from the likes of AIIMS having long academic and industry experience are also invited regularly as visiting faculty. The department also organizes lectures from experts from time to time to bring students closer to the practical working environment of industry. Faculty and students of the department are actively involved in the research.</p>
